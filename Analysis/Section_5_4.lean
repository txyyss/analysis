# Analysis I, Section 5.4

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original text.  When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful translation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:
